My name is Carolyn Fish and I am a MPH candidate at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health (New York, NY) with a focus on Epidemiology and Applied Biostatistics & Data Science.



My professional interests are positioned at the interface of basic science research and interventions for health problems affecting vulnerable populations. My work with population-based studies involves collaborating with an array of epidemiologists, clinicians, and biostatisticians to find novel solutions to critical healh problems. My current research projects range from developing high throughput lab-based methods for detecting pediatric HIV reservoir to using geospatial techniques for investigating predictors of fire-arm violence on a national scale to leveraging clinical trial data to find potential drug therapies for uterine fibroids. Through my academic and professional work, I have developed familiarity with data management, analytics, and research communications and have found a passion for finding data-solutions to complex problems.
